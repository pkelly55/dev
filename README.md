## Introduction

> This project is a Django application that provides a simple way to lock down a website to a specific IP address. It is intended to be used as a security measure for websites that are not intended to be accessed by the general public. Work in progress. The project is currently in the early stages of development. This project will secure databases and provide IP authentication for the user.

## Motivation

> This project was important for me to start because of the gap I saw in the industry while working an internship with a school and its system admins. They had a lot of issues with people trying to hack into their system and they had no way to stop it. I wanted to create a way to stop people from hacking into their systems and to make it easier for them to manage their systems. I saw how crucial IP authentication was for them and how much they needed it. I wanted to create a way to make it easier for them to manage their system and to make it more secure. Many of their attacks were coming from outside the US, this is why I wanted to create a project to secure systems from threats.
